In this project I will be creating a recipe website. The site will provide various cooking recipes in an easy to browse fashion. This site will be solely built in HTML - no CSS or Javascript.

I will be demonstrating many introductory concepts, such as headers, paragraphs, bold and italics, various lists, as well as links and images.
